## Quick start

1. Start the API service before running the project, start the 'GPSdesign-API' service. The API URL configuration can be found in `./src/config/env.ts`.
2. Run the following command to install the project dependencies (stored in node_modules):

   ```bash
   npm i --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

3. Start the development server on the default port by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

You can access the frontend at <http://localhost:port> in your browser.
